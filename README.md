## Description

This project uses a deep learning model to detect acne in facial images. It employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classification, 
allowing users to upload images and get acne predictions through an interactive Streamlit-based web interface. Git LFS is used to manage large datasets efficiently.


## Dataset 

Datset is taken from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nayanchaure/acne-dataset
